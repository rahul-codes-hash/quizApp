Absolutely — that's the best way to learn! Let's break the quiz functionality into small, **testable, logical steps**, each building on the last.

We’ll go step-by-step, testing one feature at a time before moving forward.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Plan to Build the Quiz (1 Feature at a Time)

---

### ✅ **STEP 1: Render the First Question**

**Goal**: When the page loads (or after clicking "Start"), show only the **first question and its 4 options**.

#### 🔍 What to do:

1. Create a `currentQuestionIndex` variable (starting at 0).
2. Access the first question object from your array using that index.
3. Render:

   * The question text into a DOM element (e.g., `#quiz-question`)
   * Each option as a radio button in a container (`#quiz-options`)
4. Test by refreshing the page — confirm that only the first question and 4 radio buttons appear.

---

### ✅ **STEP 2: Handle Option Selection**

**Goal**: Let the user select one of the options.

#### 🔍 What to do:

1. Group the radio buttons with the same `name` attribute so only one can be selected at a time.
2. On clicking the "Next" button, check which option is selected using `querySelector`.
3. Confirm in the console that the selected option index is being captured.

✅ **Test**: Click a few different options and log the selected value to ensure it's working.

---

### ✅ **STEP 3: Move to Next Question**

**Goal**: When "Next" is clicked, show the next question.

#### 🔍 What to do:

1. Increment `currentQuestionIndex`.
2. Call the same rendering logic as in Step 1, but now for the new question.
3. Clear old options before re-rendering.

✅ **Test**: Click "Next" repeatedly — each question should appear one after the other.

---

### ✅ **STEP 4: Track User Answers**

**Goal**: Record which option the user selected for each question.

#### 🔍 What to do:

1. Create a `userAnswers` array.
2. When a user selects an answer and clicks "Next", store the selected index for that question into `userAnswers[currentQuestionIndex]`.
3. For unanswered questions (e.g., timeout or skip), store `null`.

✅ **Test**: Log the `userAnswers` array after each click to confirm it's storing values correctly.

---

### ✅ **STEP 5: Add a 10-Second Timer Per Question**

**Goal**: Each question should have a 10-second countdown.

#### 🔍 What to do:

1. Use `setInterval` to count down every second.
2. Display remaining time in a `#quiz-timer` element.
3. When the timer reaches 0:

   * Store `null` as the answer
   * Move to the next question
   * Reset the timer

✅ **Test**: Let the timer run out — make sure it auto-advances and the answer is recorded as `null`.

---

### ✅ **STEP 6: Score the Quiz**

**Goal**: Count how many answers were correct.

#### 🔍 What to do:

1. After the last question, loop through `userAnswers` and compare each with the correct `answer` from your `questionsArray`.
2. Count correct answers into a `score` variable.
3. Display the final score in a result screen (`#result-screen`).

✅ **Test**: Answer a few questions correctly, finish the quiz, and check if the score is accurate.

---

### ✅ **STEP 7: Show Review Screen**

**Goal**: Let the user see all questions with:

* Their selected answer
* The correct answer
* Visual indicators

#### 🔍 What to do:

1. Create a new section (`#review-container`) to hold review blocks.
2. Loop through each question:

   * Show the question and options
   * Highlight the correct answer in **green**
   * Highlight the user’s incorrect answer in **red**
3. Add a button to go to this screen after finishing the quiz.

✅ **Test**: Complete a quiz and click “Review” — verify correct/incorrect indicators match your choices.

---

## ✅ Optional Next Steps (After Core Is Working)

These are more advanced — do these after you're comfortable with the above:

* 🔁 Add a "Restart Quiz" button that resets everything
* 📊 Add a progress bar (% complete)
* 💾 Store past scores in `localStorage`
* 📱 Make it mobile-friendly
* 🧠 Shuffle questions or options
* ⏸ Add pause/resume for the timer
